0.I'm not foing anywhere.You can print that wherever you want to.I'm here and i'm a spure for life mandator

. Prototype: int_printf(const char *format, ...);
Write a function that priduces output according to a format.

. c
. s
. %

. You don't have to  reproduce the buffer handling of the C library printf function
. You don't have to handle the flag characters
. You don't have to  handle field width
. You don't have to handle precision
. You don't have to handle the length modifiers

1.Education is when you read the fine print.Ecperience is what you get if you don't

This program handles the conversion specifiers 'd' and 'i'.It is a simple implementation that
doesn't handle flag characters, field width, precision, or length modifiers.

The purpose of this program is to  demonstarte how to handle basic conversion specifiers in 
C programming language.It is intended for educational purpose only.

To use this program, simple include the source code in your project and call the 'printf'
function with the desired conversion specifier.The program will return the corresponding
integer value.

Please note this program is not intended for production use and should not be used in 
any critical or high-risk applications.Use at your own risk.

If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to open an issue on Github.Thank you
for using our program!
